# ARP Poisoning
ARP poisoning or ARP Spoofing is a cyber attack carried out over a local area network which involves sending malicious ARP packets to the victim and default gateway such that the attack causes the corruption or modification of cached ARP table thereby making an attacker a Man-in-the-Middle.

# Description
This repository contains a python code using which one can try ARP poisoning ON THEIR OWN LOCAL AREA NETWORK (LAN) network. This code is only for educational purposes.

This repository also contains a presentation on this project which will help you understand this project better.
